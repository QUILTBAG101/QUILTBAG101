	*Asexuality is a lack of sexual attraction to anyone.*
        An asexual person is a person who doesn't experience sexual attraction.

        *Asexuals often refer to themselves as "ace." Aromantic asexuals often
        use "aro-ace."*

        *Asexuals are capable of having sex and masturbating - some do. Some
        ace people dislike sex, but others can enjoy it.* 
        The primary identifying characteristic is a lack or very small sexual
        attraction to other people, not action.

        *Asexuals are not necessarily aromantic - some have the desire for
        romantic relationships.*

        *Asexuality is a spectrum. A grey-asexual (Grey-A) can include people
        who experience sexual attraction or a sex drive very rarely.*

        *A Demisexual is a person who doesn't experience sexual attraction
        without a strong emotional connection.*

        *Asexuality is a matter of identity, not of action. It is distinct from
        chastity - refraining from having sex.*

        *Asexuality is a perfectly healthy variation on human sexuality, and
        asexuals can live fulfilling lives.*

NOTES:
Asexuality
    Asexual people aren’t sexually attracted to anyone. 

    Some asexual people call themselves ‘aces’ for short.

    These people can still have a libido (get horny) and/or enjoy sex. They may
    also dislike sex, or be indifferent.

    These people can still form strong, meaningful romantic relationships.

    Asexuality is not the same as celibacy. Celibate people may feel sexual
    attraction but choose not to have sex; asexual people are not sexually
    attracted to people but may still choose to have sex for other reasons.
