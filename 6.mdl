	*Asexuality is a lack of sexual attraction to anyone. It is not the 
        same as celibacy, the choice not to have sex.*
        Asexuals often refer to themselves as "ace." Aromantic asexuals often
        use "aro-ace."

        *Asexuals are capable of having sex and masturbating - some do. Some
        ace people dislike sex, but others can enjoy it.* 
        Just because somone has sex, or enjoys it, It doesn't mean they're 
        not asexual.

        *Asexuality is a spectrum. A grey-asexual (Grey-A) can include people
        who experience sexual attraction or a sex drive very rarely.*

        *A Demisexual is a person who doesn't experience sexual attraction
        without a strong emotional connection.*
        Demisexuals don't feel attraction to people without this bond, rather 
        than making a choice not to have sex with them.

NOTES:
Asexuality
    Asexual people aren’t sexually attracted to anyone. 

    Some asexual people call themselves ‘aces’ for short.

    These people can still have a libido (get horny) and/or enjoy sex. They may
    also dislike sex, or be indifferent.

    These people can still form strong, meaningful romantic relationships.

    Asexuality is not the same as celibacy. Celibate people may feel sexual
    attraction but choose not to have sex; asexual people are not sexually
    attracted to people but may still choose to have sex for other reasons.
