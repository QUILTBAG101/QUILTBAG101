Asexuality
    Asexual people aren’t sexually attracted to anyone. 

    Some asexual people call themselves ‘aces’ for short.

    These people can still have a libido (get horny) and/or enjoy sex. They may
    also dislike sex, or be indifferent.

    These people can still form strong, meaningful romantic relationships.

    Asexuality is not the same as celibacy. Celibate people may feel sexual
    attraction but choose not to have sex; asexual people are not sexually
    attracted to people but may still choose to have sex for other reasons.
