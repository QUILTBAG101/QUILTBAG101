Asexuality
    Some people aren't sexuality attracted to anyone. 
    These people can still have a libodo(get horny) and enjoy sex. 
    These people can still form strong, meaningfull, romantic relationships. 
    asexuality is not the same as celibacy: Celibate people choose not to have
    sex, asexual people are not sexually attracted to people
