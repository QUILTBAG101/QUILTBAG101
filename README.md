QUILTBAG101
===========

QUILTBAG 101, a static site to quickly explain QUILTBAG issues to laypeople.

Built around twelve sections, each explaining an issue quickly and cleanly 
to anyone who'll listen

#How can I help?
We really need people of diverse sexualites and genders to check that we're
getting stuff right.
At the moment we're just putting down notes about what content we're putting 
in each slide, but we may need devs later(ruby/frontend)
##Where do you need help?
Take a look at sections that apply to you, or that you think you've to somthing
to add to- Check thet we've got everything right, whether there's anything
you'd add, or any notes we should add. We also need lots of reasources on
QUILTAG+ness to go in the further reading section: Please add these!

##How do I add things?
If you have a github account, you can open an issue or Fork and pull request.
This is prefered, but we'd prefer it if you'd [email
us](mailto:drcable+QUILTBAG@tarbwf.com), [ask us on
tumblr](http://quiltbag101.tumblr.com/ask) or [tweet to
us](http://twitter.com/home/?status=@QUILTBAG101 ) than did nothing.

#You're oversimplifying.
Yes. We are. This is the tradeoff we make in return for having an easy to read
reasource that people will actually read. We're going to have to simplify and
say some things that aren't precisley accurate in the name of fitting it into
peoples heads. all the sections will have links expanding on the content
encouraging people to get more subtlty in their worldveiw. 

That said, if you find somthing offensive, we'll work as hard as we possibly
can to fix it, be it somthing we've got wrong, a language change, or somthing
else entirley.
