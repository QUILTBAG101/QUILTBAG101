QUILTBAG101
===========

QUILTBAG 101, a static site to quickly explain QUILTBAG issues to laypeople.

Built around twelve sections, each explaining an issue quickly and cleanly 
to anyone who'll listen

#How can I help?
Please send any corrections to us, or send us bugfixes
##Where do you need help?
We're going to re-do this from the ground up, graphically, but for now please fix anything you can :)
##How do I add things?
If you have a github account, you can open an issue or Fork and pull request.
This is prefered, but we'd prefer it if you'd [email
us](mailto:drcable+QUILTBAG@tarbwf.com), [ask us on
tumblr](http://quiltbag101.tumblr.com/ask) or [tweet to
us](http://twitter.com/home/?status=@QUILTBAG101 ) than did nothing. 
Here's some quick links to all the sections:

If you're going to commit via github directly, please don't use smart quotes, 
use four space-tabs and wrap your lines at 80ch, unless you're embedding links.

#You're oversimplifying.
Yes. We are. This is the tradeoff we make in return for having an easy to read
reasource that people will actually read. We're going to have to simplify and
say some things that aren't precisley accurate in the name of fitting it into
peoples heads. all the sections will have links expanding on the content
encouraging people to get more subtlty in their worldveiw. 

That said, if you find somthing offensive, we'll work as hard as we possibly
can to fix it, be it somthing we've got wrong, a language change, or somthing
else entirley.
