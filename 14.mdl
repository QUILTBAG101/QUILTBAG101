Sex and Gender:

Sex refers to biological attributes - primary and secondary sexual characteristics, chromosomes and hormones.

Gender identity refers to a person's internal sense of gender. Whether they are a man, a woman or something else.

Sex isn't binary. Some people's bodies don't fit neatly into the "male" or "female" categories of sex.

Gender isn't binary. Some people don't identify with being a man or a woman.

Gender expression is how a person physically present themselves. For example: wearing masculine or feminine clothes.
