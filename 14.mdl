	Sex refers to biological attributes - primary and secondary sexual characteristics, chromosomes and hormones.

	Gender identity refers to a person's internal sense of gender. Whether they are a man, a woman or something else.
	Gender identity is what we usually refer to as "gender", but there are a few facets with it. Using gender is perfectly acceptable though.
	
	Sex isn't binary. Some people's bodies don't fit neatly into the "male" or "female" categories of sex.
	See the intersex section. Additionally, trans people who have undergone medical or surgical treatment are also difficult to classify the sex of.

	Gender isn't binary. Some are neither a man nor a woman.
	These people are non-binary trans* - see the trans* section.

	Gender expression is how a person physically presents themselves. For example: wearing masculine or feminine clothes.
	Gender expression is volatile - it can vary day to day as someone wears different clothes, uses different make-up and so on.
	
	A person will have a gender assigned to them at birth. This will be the gender put on your (first) birth certificate.
	The gender assigned is usually based on the genitalia of the person at birth. In some cases, it's difficult to make a decision. See Intersex.

	A person who's gender matches that assigned to them at birth is called cisgender (cis.)
	Cis is not an insult or a disparaging comment, it simply means their gender is that which they were assigned at birth.

	A person who's gender is different to that assigned to them at birth is called transgender (trans.)
	See the trans* section.
