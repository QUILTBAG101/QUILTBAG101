Romantic and Sexual Orientation
    For some people(often, but not limited to asexual people), the pattern of people they are romantically attracted to
    differs from the pattern they are sexually attracted to. 
    
    Romantic and Sexual orientation are not necessarily linked, but usually are.
    
    A person can be romantically attracted to someone, but not sexually attracted to them.
    
    
    It's possible to be, say, pansexual but homoromantic. In that case, the person would be
    sexually attracted to people of all genders but only romantically attracted to people of
    the same gender.

Draft:
Sexual orientation refers to a person’s patterns of sexual attraction.

Romantic orientation refers to a person’s patterns of desire for romantic relationships with people.

In a lot of cases, people’s sexual and romantic orientations are the same - and hence, they don’t distinguish the two.

But, for some people, their sexual and romantic orientation can be mismatched. Someone could be pansexual but homoromantic.
In that case, you would be sexually attracted to people of all genders but only desiring romantic relations with someone of the same gender.

A lot of the people who have mismatched sexual and romantic orientation are asexual, but it’s in no way limited to them.
