Romantic and Sexual Orientation
    For some people, the pattern of people they are romantically attracted to
    differs from the pattern they are sexually attracted to.
    
    Romantic and Sexual orientation are not necessarily linked, but usually are.
    
    A person can be romantically attracted to someone, but not sexually attracted to them.
    
    Some asexuals are aromantic, but others are heteroromantic, homoromantic, bi/panromantic
    and so on. Same applies to aromantics.
    
    It's possible to be, say, pansexual but homoromantic. In that case, the person would be
    sexually attracted to people of all genders but only romantically attracted to people of
    the same gender.
