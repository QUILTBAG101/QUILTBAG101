*sex and intersex
Page Draft:
        *Sex refers to biological attributes - primary and secondary sexual
        characteristics, chromosomes and hormones.*
        There are a number of ways you could define sex - a more
        comprehensive one takes into account a wide range of sex-determined
        characteristics.

        *Sex is not the same thing as [gender](link to gender/trans section).*

        *Intersex people do not fit into a binary (male/female) model of sex*
        Approximately 1% of people fit the label "Intersex"
        (http://www.isna.org/faq/frequency)*

        *Intersex people are often 'fixed' at a young age, without their 
        consent. This should not be done*

	
        *Sex isn't binary. Some people's bodies don't fit neatly into the
        "male" or "female" categories of sex.*
