Page Draft:
	Transgender people are people who's gender are different to that to that they were assigned at birth.
	If you haven't read the Sex and Gender section, go and do so now.

	Trans people can be either binary or non-binary trans.

	There are two types of binary trans people: trans men (female-to-male) and trans women (male-to-female).

	A trans woman is a woman. A trans man is a man. Treat them accordingly.

	Non-binary people come in a variety of different types and labels, including: genderqueer, genderfluid and agender/neutrosis.

	Some non-binary trans people will have pronouns they want to you to use. Use them - if you don't know, ask.
	Binary trans people will probably want the pronouns of their gender.

	A lot of trans people will have some level of discomfort with their bodies. This is known as dysphoria.

	There are medical and surgical options available to allow a trans person to alter their bodies.

	It's none of your business what procedures a trans person has undertaken, nor do you have a right to know about their genitals.

NOTES:
Trans people
    Trans people are born with a body that is not the same as their gender.
    Sometimes they man or a woman, sometimes somewhere intbetween
    and sometimes completey unrelated to traditional genders. 
    Trans people may look like ("present') however they want; this does not
    change their gender identity.
