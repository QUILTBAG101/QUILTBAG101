        *Bisexuality is attraction to more than one gender. Pansexuality is
        attraction to all genders.* 
        The two labels can overlap, and these are not strict definitions- the 
        person gets to decide what label/s they use.

        *Sometimes more than one label can be applicable - respect the person’s
        choice of them.*
        No label is wrong, and they can often have deep meaning to an
        individual person.

        *Bi/Pansexuals aren’t attracted to everyone, just have the capacity to
        be attracted to more genders.* 
        In the same way a gay or straight person isn’t attracted to all people
        of the same/”opposite”-gender.

        *Bi/Pansexuals aren’t promiscuous or more liable to cheat. Some are,
        but not \*because\* they’re bisexual.*
        Preference for non-monogamy is independent to sexual orientation.
        Similarly, whether somebody is trustworthy doesn’t depend on their
        orientation.

        *Bi/Pansexuality is a valid orientation, not just a phase. It can be a
        phase for some, and that’s ok.*
        Bi/Pansexual people can and do keep their orientations throughout their
        lives. Some do use it as a “transitional” state, but a lot do not.

        *They don’t necessarily want to have sex with you, or a threesome. They
        might do, but not /*because/* they’re bisexual.*  
        In particular, a lot of Bi/Pansexuals don’t want to have sex with
        people who think that Bi/Pansexuals want to have sex with everyone.

        *A Bi/Pansexual doesn’t become gay or straight if they start a
        monogamous relationship.*
        Sexual orientation doesn’t go away - it’s a matter of the capacity and
        patterns of attraction, not what (or who) they’re currently doing.

        *Don’t assume that someone in a same-gender relationship is gay. They
        might be Bi/Pansexual or some other orientation.* 
        Similarly, a person in an “opposite”-gender relationship isn’t
        necessarily straight.

        *Someone being Bi/Pansexual doesn’t mean that you have the right to ask
        them invasive questions.* 
        Who they’ve had relationships or sex with is none of your business.

NOTES:
Pansexual, Bisexual etc. people.
    They exist. They are not gay and afraid to come out. Neither are they doing it for the attention.
    They just have the capacity to experience sexual attraction to people of more than one gender.
    They don't want to sex everyone.
    They (probably) do not want to have a threesome with you. And if they do, it's not *because* they're bi or pan.
    Non-monosexuals are not necessarily poly, but they can be.
    Some people use bisexual to mean "attracted to men and women"; some use it to mean "attracted to people regardless of gender".
    Some people prefer pansexual, because they believe bisexual enforces the gender binary, or for other reasons.
    Other people prefer bisexual.
