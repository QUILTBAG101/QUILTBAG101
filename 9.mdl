        *Queer is a slur used to attack QUILTBAG+ people and you 
        should be carefull about using it*
        While a lot of work has gone on to reclaim it as an identity, Ask 
        before you applay it to people.

        *Queer is an umbrella term for people in gender and sexual minorities -
        arguably, anything not mainstream.*
        It is however, an agressivley politically charged term. Some "UILTBAG+"
        people reject "queer".

        *Some people prefer to use Queer as a label instead of anything else.
        This is perfectly fine.*

        *However, you should be careful with using the word Queer to refer to
        other people. It has a long and painful history for some.*

        *Unsure is also part of the QUILTBAG acronym. People who are Unsure
        are unsure about their gender or sexual identity.*
        Some people also use "questioning" in place of unsure.

NOTES:
