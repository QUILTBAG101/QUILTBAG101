        *Lesbian and Gay people are homosexual - that is, sexually attracted to
        people of the same gender.*
        and only people of the same gender. There are other sexualities that
        deal with people attracted to many genders.

        *Lesbian refers to a woman attracted to women, gay refers to a man
        attracted to men.*
        Although sometimes people use "gay" as an umbrella term for lesbians and
        gays.

        *"Androphilia" and "Gynophilia" can also be used. These meaning
        "Attracted to men, males and masculinity" and the opposite.*
        This is common among people with non-binary genders.

NOTES: Lesbian and gay people If a person says they're lesbian or gay, it
generally means that they're attracted to people of the same gender as
themselves: A man wants to sex men, and a woman wants to sex women.  Nothing
more, nothing less.
