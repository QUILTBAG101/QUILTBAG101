            Sometimes this means a partner is allowed to have sex as long as
            there's no romantic or emotional attachment. Other times they're
            allowed to form full relationships.

              There are many forms of Polyamorous relationship. Relationships can be
              negotiated and re-negotiated to fit the partners' needs.
            </h1>
            Boundaries often have to be renegotiated as
            the partners realise they are more or less comfortable with certain things.

              Different poly relationships will be more or less restrictive about the
              conditions of one of the partners having outside relations.
            </h1>
            These conditions might include having the right to veto a partners'
            partner and being informed (or never informed) of their partners'
            goings on.

              Polyamory isn't for everyone. It may not be for you, but don't judge
              people on their preference either way.

            To recap
          </h1>
          <section>
            <h1>
              Don't assume anything. You can't tell a person's sexuality by who they're
              dating or who they've dated, for instance.
            </h1>
          </section>
          Following this simple rule will result in a 99% reduction in the amount of
          times you put your foot in your mouth.

            <h1>
              Use the pronouns that someone requests you use. If you're not sure about them,
              ask politely.
            </h1>
            Pronouns really aren't that hard to learn. Don't complain that
            they're "made up" or gramatically incorrect, just use them.

              Different QUILTBAG groups have different needs and problems. Be aware of this
              when dealing with them.
            </h1>
            There are also some problems that arise as a result of
            being several identities - this is known as intersectionality.

              If someone asks you not to talk about something because it's causing them
              distress, stop talking about it.
            </h1>
            When writing you should also use [trigger warnings](basic trigger
            warning description] to warn people about possibly distressing content.
          </section>
          <section>
            <h1>
              Don't ask intrusive questions. Just because a person is different, it doesn't
              mean they want to be asked awkward questions.
            </h1>
            This means: Don't ask trans people about their genitals, don't ask bi/pan
            people who they've slept with and so on.
