Plan:
A website where people unsure about how to deal with somone who's QUILTBAG+, Or is questioning their own cisHetness. It'll be simple, easy to navigate, written like buzfeed. Think Oh joy sex toy in attitude. 
Should cover all the basics, and have science to back up every claim. 
Consisting of about 12(nice do design for) sections, like http://mseckington.github.io/wow-hack/ but less interactive(questiony. ), more fun, and with a bit more information. 
Possibly guided by a fun anthropomirphised Quilt in a bag.
Proably done in ruby/nanoc/haml/scss/coffeescript, unless others have strong stack prefernces. either hosted on my box or on gh pages.

Below is my brainstorm, and how  to break down the issues. Please comment, pass around, add anything you think is missing, delete anything you think is too advanced, etc. Or do whole sections of the todo list.

Issues, and how to break them down.
    Sexuality
        people can be gay, bi(pan/etc), straight, or some complex mix
        Myths around each. How to deal with people non-het people.
            just because somone is X, and you're in the group they want to sex, this does not mean they want to sex you. relax.
            All the BI things elmyra squashed
    gender
        some people are not cis.
        Genitals do not matter.
            intersex
        People can be Male, female, none of the above.People change
            Fluidity

    Asexuality
        A thing.
        Myths. 
        Possibly.
    Queer and unsure
        Some people are not sure, or choose to use broader labels.
        this is fine. 
        Just treat us with respect.

Split into slides like:
    Introduction.
        Hi. 
        somone probably linked you here because you need/want to learn a bit more about QUILTBAG peeps. 
        This'll only take five minuites, and will mean you don't piss off anyone in future, and can be considrered cosmopolitan and cool.
    GL
        Some people are kinda gay. This means they like people of the same sex. This is cool, somthing you are born with, and you should not try to cure them. they are not here to tenmpt you from the path to savation. 
        They peobably don't want to sex you. Stop getting all excited.
        Other myths. Not hot mon my GL stuff.
    BQ
        Some people are BI.
        Queer deffinition. If we can find one. 
        This means that they like to sex people of more than one gender. 
        This too is cool, also not hellish. 
        They do not want to threesome you(unless they do).
        Some people like other words(pan/etc)
    Asexuality
        Some people don't want to sex anyone. 
        They canot be cured by a good fuck. Stop it. 
        Myths?
    romantiscism/sexuality/etc.
        Some people feel romantic attraction but not sexual attraction.
        Some people are really horny, but still don't want to fuck you. 
        Myths?
    Trans binary people
        Sex is a word for the genitals and body you're born with.
        Gender is a word for whether you're a man or a woman. 
        Some people are a different gender from their sex. 
        This is cool. Also non-demonic in origin.
        Gender is a social construct: It's a real thing, but there's nothing scientific that says we are men or women.
        Myths?
    trans non-binary/gender fluid/etc.
        Some people don't fit into male or female.
        They may be somewhere inbetween.
        They may be somewhere else entirley.
        They may be a dude one day, and a woman the next. and a monster from mars the next.
        Myths?
    Presentation, identity and "birth sex".
        Some people are dudes who like to dress femme/visa versa. 
        Presentation is a choice.
        birth sex is only important to doctors
        Myths?
    Intersex people are real.
        They're not fixable either. Stop with the fixing already.
        Myths?
    How not to be a dick. 
        Assumptions you shouldn't make(again)
        Pronouns, how to not offend anyone.
        Triggers?
        Privilege? Or at least not writing about these issues unless you know a lot and check it with people if you think it might be risky.
    further reading. 
        A good summary in longer form? Does anyone know of one?
        Counceling numbers/emails/etc.
        Coming out materials
        Anything else?
    Goodbye.
        Stick with what we've tolld you, and in civilized company, you'll be fine. See you round :)
