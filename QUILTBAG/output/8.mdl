        *Gender identity is a  persons sense of gender: whether they feel they 
        are male, female of somthing else*
        People who feel they are somthing else are called non-binary.

        *A person will have a gender assigned to them at birth. This will be
        the gender put on your (first) birth certificate.* 
        The gender assigned is usually based on the genitalia of the person at
        birth. In some cases, it's difficult to make a decision. See Intersex.

        *Transgender people are people who's gender are different to that to
        that they were assigned at birth.*
        A person who's gender matches that assigned to them at birth is called
        cisgender (cis.)

        *Trans\* identities are a spectrum: there are more options than male or
        female, such as genderqueer.*
        These are called "non-binary" genders. The traditional man/woman
        genders are not used in all societies.

        *Most trans\* people have pronouns they want to you to use. Use them -
        if you don't know, ask.* 

        *Gender expression is how a person physically presents themselves. For
        example: wearing masculine or feminine clothes.*
        Gender expression Doesn't nessicerrily corrleate to gender identiy, 
        or any other part of their person.

        *A lot of trans people will have some level of discomfort with their
        bodies. This is known as dysphoria.*

        *Some trans* people will undertake procedures such as surgery or hormone
        replacments.* 
        This does not make them "more trans". What procedures somone has undertaken are non of your buisness.

        *It's none of your business what procedures a trans person has
        undertaken*
        Medical procedures are personal choice available to some trans* people,
        but choosing not undergo them if they have this option does not make
        somone less trans\*
        
        *Gender can be fluid - it can change over time, sometimes very
        rapidly.*
        People who's gender is very fluid often identify as
        genderfluid.



NOTES:
Trans people
    Trans people are born with a body that is not the same as their gender.
    Sometimes they man or a woman, sometimes somewhere intbetween
    and sometimes completey unrelated to traditional genders. 
    Trans people may look like ("present') however they want; this does not
    change their gender identity.
