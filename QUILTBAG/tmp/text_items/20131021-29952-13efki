          Polyamory literally means 'many loves' - it's a relationship
          structure that's inclusive of the partners having other partners..

        <h1>
          Polyamory is 'consensual non-monogamy' - that is, a relationship
          can only be considered poly if everyone agrees.
        </h1>
        The opposite of this is non-consensual non-monogamy - I.E. cheating.

          Poly relationships allow the partners to have other romantic and/or
          sexual partners.
        </h1>
        Sometimes this means a partner is allowed to have sex as long as
        there's no romantic or emotional attachment. Other times they're
        allowed to form full relationships.

        <h1>
          There are many forms of Polyamorous relationship. Relationships can be
          negotiated and re-negotiated to fit the partners' needs.
        </h1>
        Boundaries often have to be renegotiated as
        the partners realise they are more or less comfortable with certain things.

        <h1>
          Different poly relationships will be more or less restrictive about the
          conditions of one of the partners having outside relations.
        </h1>
        These conditions might include having the right to veto a partners'
        partner and being informed (or never informed) of their partners'
        goings on.

          Polyamory isn't for everyone. It may not be for you, but don't judge
          people on their preference either way.
