        <em>Queer is a slur used to attack QUILTBAG+ people that some have adopted
        as an identity.</em>
        Queer is a political, sexual and gender identity. It is often used in
        conjunction with other identities.</p>

<pre><code>    *However, you should be incredibly careful with using the word Queer to
    refer to other people.*
    Many people feel that queer is insulting to them, or they do not fit
    under the queer umbrella.

    *People use it as a term to refer to all politically marginialized
    gender and sexual identities.*
    This includes trans* people, kinky people, and non-monsexual people. 

    *Unsure is also part of the QUILTBAG acronym. People who are Unsure
    are unsure about their gender or sexual identity.*
    Some people also use "questioning" in place of unsure.
