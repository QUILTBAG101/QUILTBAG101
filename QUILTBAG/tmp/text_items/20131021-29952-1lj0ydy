      NOTES: Introduction section Welcome to QUILTBAG 101, a primer for people who
      need to know more about sexuality and gender.  What is QUILTBAG? It stands for:
      Q - Queer/Questioning U - Unsure
      I - Intersex
      L - Lesbian
      T - Trans*
      B - Bisexual
      A - Asexual

      Over the next few slides, we're going to roll through what all of those
      mean to different people, and how many people who identify with one or
      more of those categories would like you to treat them.
      We're not trying to speak for everyone, but this will probably stop you from
      making any mortal enemies, and we'll recommend some more thorough reading
      later on.
