          Don't assume anything. You can't tell a person's sexuality by who they're
          dating or who they've dated, for instance.
        </h1>

      Following this simple rule will result in a 99% reduction in the amount of
      times you put your foot in your mouth.

        <h1>
          Use the pronouns that someone requests you use. If you're not sure about them,
          ask politely.
        </h1>
        Pronouns really aren't that hard to learn. Don't complain that
        they're "made up" or gramatically incorrect, just use them.

        <h1>
          Different QUILTBAG groups have different needs and problems. Be aware of this
          when dealing with them.
        </h1>
        There are also some problems that arise as a result of
        being several identities - this is known as intersectionality.

        <h1>
          If someone asks you not to talk about something because it's causing them
          distress, stop talking about it.
        </h1>
        When writing you should also use [trigger warnings](basic trigger
        warning description] to warn people about possibly distressing content.

        <h1>
          Don't ask intrusive questions. Just because a person is different, it doesn't
          mean they want to be asked awkward questions.
        </h1>
        This means: Don't ask trans people about their genitals, don't ask bi/pan
        people who they've slept with and so on.
