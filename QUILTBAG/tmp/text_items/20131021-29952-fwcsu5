      *Don't assume anything. You can't tell a person's sexuality by who they're
      dating or who they've dated, for instance.*
      Following this simple rule will result in a 99% reduction in the amount of
      times you put your foot in your mouth.
      *Use the pronouns that someone requests you use. If you're not sure about them,
      ask politely. *
      Pronouns really aren't that hard to learn. Don't complain that
      they're "made up" or gramatically incorrect, just use them.
      *Different QUILTBAG groups have different needs and problems. Be aware of this
      when dealing with them.*
      There are also some problems that arise as a result of
      being several identities - this is known as intersectionality.
      *If someone asks you not to talk about something because it's causing them
      distress, stop talking about it.*
      When writing you should also use [trigger warnings](basic trigger
      warning description] to warn people about possibly distressing content.
      *Don't ask intrusive questions. Just because a person is different, it doesn't
      mean they want to be asked awkward questions.*
      This means: Don't ask trans people about their genitals, don't ask bi/pan
      people who they've slept with and so on.
      NOTES:
      How not to be a jerk?
      First off, don't assume anything. You can't tell what a persons sexuality
      is by looking at them, who they're dating, or who they've dated. If somone
      straight has never dated anyone, does that make them asexual? Nope. The
      only way is to ask.  If you see somone who you think might be trans, treat
      them as the gender they're presenting as. If you're confused, ask politley
      which pronouns you should use to describe them.
      Be aware that QUILTBAG people are going to have different needs and
      different problems - the needs of people who are QUILTBAG can also differ
      based on circumstances and how their different identities interact.
      If somone asks you to not talk aout something because it's causing them
      distress, stop talking aout it. If you know a certain topic may be
      distressing, put a note warning people at the top so you don't trigger a
      panic attack, or similar.
