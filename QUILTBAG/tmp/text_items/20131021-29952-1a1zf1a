        <em>Lesbian and Gay people are homosexual - that is, sexually attracted to
        people of the same gender.</em>
        and only people of the same gender. There are other sexualities that
        deal with people attracted to many genders.</p>

<pre><code>    *Lesbian refers to a woman attracted to women, gay refers to a man
    attracted to men.*
    Although sometimes people use "gay" as an umbrella term for lesbians and
    gays.

    *"Androphilia" and "Gynophilia" can also be used. These meaning
    "Attracted to men, males and masculinity" and the opposite.*
    This is common among people with non-binary genders.

<p>NOTES: Lesbian and gay people If a person says they’re lesbian or gay, it
generally means that they’re attracted to people of the same gender as
themselves: A man wants to sex men, and a woman wants to sex women.  Nothing
more, nothing less. </p>
