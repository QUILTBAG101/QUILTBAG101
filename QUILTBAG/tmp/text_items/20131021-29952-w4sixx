        <h1>
          Bisexuality is attraction to more than one gender. Pansexuality is
          attraction to all genders.
        </h1>
        The two can overlap, and these are not strict definitions. The
        person gets to decide what label/s they use - please respect that.

        <h1>
          Bi/Pansexuals aren’t attracted to everyone, just have the capacity to
          be attracted to more genders.
        </h1>
        In the same way a gay or straight person isn’t attracted to all people
        of the same/”opposite”-gender.

        <h1>
          Bi/Pansexuals aren’t promiscuous or more liable to cheat. Some are,
          but not because they’re bisexual.
        </h1>
        Neither trustworthiness nor preference for non-monogamy are related to
        sexual orientation.

        <h1>
          Bi/Pansexuality is a valid orientation, not just a phase. It can be a
          phase for some, and that’s ok.

        <h1>
          They don’t necessarily want to have sex with you, or a threesome. They
          might do, but not because they’re bisexual.
        </h1>

      <section>
        <h1>
          A Bi/Pansexual doesn’t become gay or straight if they start a
          monogamous relationship.
        </h1>
        Sexual orientation doesn’t go away. Don't assume people's orientation
        based on what (or who) they are currently doing.
