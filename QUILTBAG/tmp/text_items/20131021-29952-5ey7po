    <em>Sexual orientation refers to a person’s patterns of sexual
    attraction.</em></p>

<pre><code>*Romantic orientation refers to a person’s patterns of desire for
romantic relationships with people.*

*Often sexual and romantic orientation are he same but they can be different- You can be Pan butgq
homoromantic*
I.E. you would be sexually attracted to people of all genders but only
desiring romantic relations with someone of the same gender.

*A lot of the people who have mismatched sexual and romantic orientation
are asexual, but it’s in no way limited to them.*

<p>NOTES: 
Romantic and Sexual Orientation
    For some people(often, but not limited to asexual people), the pattern of
    people they are romantically attracted to differs from the pattern they are
    sexually attracted to. </p>

<pre><code>Romantic and Sexual orientation are not necessarily linked, but usually
are.

A person can be romantically attracted to someone, but not sexually
attracted to them.


It's possible to be, say, pansexual but homoromantic. In that case, the
person would be sexually attracted to people of all genders but only
romantically attracted to people of the same gender.
