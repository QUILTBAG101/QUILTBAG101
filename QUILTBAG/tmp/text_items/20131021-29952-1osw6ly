          Asexuality is a lack of sexual attraction to anyone. It is not the
          same as celibacy, the choice not to have sex.
        </h1>
        Asexuals often refer to themselves as "ace." Aromantic asexuals often
        use "aro-ace."

          Asexuals are capable of having sex and masturbating - some do. Some
          ace people dislike sex, but others can enjoy it.
        </h1>
        Just because somone has sex, or enjoys it, It doesn't mean they're
        not asexual.

          who experience sexual attraction or a sex drive very rarely.

          A Demisexual is a person who doesn't experience sexual attraction
          without a strong emotional connection.
        </h1>
        Demisexuals don't feel attraction to people without this bond, rather
        than making a choice not to have sex with them.
