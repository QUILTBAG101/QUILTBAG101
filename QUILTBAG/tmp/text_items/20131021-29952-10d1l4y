        Page Draft:
        *Bisexuality is attraction to more than one gender. Pansexuality is
        attraction to all genders.*
        The two can overlap, and these are not strict definitions. The
        person gets to decide what label/s they use - please respect that.
        *Bi/Pansexuals aren’t attracted to everyone, just have the capacity to
        be attracted to more genders.*
        In the same way a gay or straight person isn’t attracted to all people
        of the same/”opposite”-gender.
        *Bi/Pansexuals aren’t promiscuous or more liable to cheat. Some are,
        but not \*because\* they’re bisexual.*
        Neither trustworthiness nor preference for non-monogamy are related to
        sexual orientation.
        *Bi/Pansexuality is a valid orientation, not just a phase. It can be a
        phase for some, and that’s ok.*
        *They don’t necessarily want to have sex with you, or a threesome. They
        might do, but not /*because/* they’re bisexual.*
        *A Bi/Pansexual doesn’t become gay or straight if they start a
        monogamous relationship.*
        Sexual orientation doesn’t go away. Don't assume people's orientation
        based on what (or who) they are currently doing.
        NOTES:
        Pansexual, Bisexual etc. people.
        They exist. They are not gay and afraid to come out. Neither are they doing it for the attention.
        They just have the capacity to experience sexual attraction to people of more than one gender.
        They don't want to sex everyone.
        They (probably) do not want to have a threesome with you. And if they do, it's not *because* they're bi or pan.
        Non-monosexuals are not necessarily poly, but they can be.
        Some people use bisexual to mean "attracted to men and women"; some use it to mean "attracted to people regardless of gender".
        Some people prefer pansexual, because they believe bisexual enforces the gender binary, or for other reasons.
        Other people prefer bisexual.

        *Lesbian and Gay people are homosexual - that is, sexually attracted to
        people of the same gender.*
        and only people of the same gender. There are other sexualities that
        deal with people attracted to many genders.
        *Lesbian refers to a woman attracted to women, gay refers to a man
        attracted to men.*
        Although sometimes people use "gay" as an umbrella term for lesbians and
        gays.
        *"Androphilia" and "Gynophilia" can also be used. These meaning
        "Attracted to men, males and masculinity" and the opposite.*
        This is common among people with non-binary genders.
        NOTES: Lesbian and gay people If a person says they're lesbian or gay, it
        generally means that they're attracted to people of the same gender as
        themselves: A man wants to sex men, and a woman wants to sex women.  Nothing
        more, nothing less.

          basics
        </h1>
        *Don't assume anything. You can't tell a person's sexuality by who they're
        dating or who they've dated, for instance.*
        Following this simple rule will result in a 99% reduction in the amount of
        times you put your foot in your mouth.
        *Use the pronouns that someone requests you use. If you're not sure about them,
        ask politely. *
        Pronouns really aren't that hard to learn. Don't complain that
        they're "made up" or gramatically incorrect, just use them.
        *Different QUILTBAG groups have different needs and problems. Be aware of this
        when dealing with them.*
        There are also some problems that arise as a result of
        being several identities - this is known as intersectionality.
        *If someone asks you not to talk about something because it's causing them
        distress, stop talking about it.*
        When writing you should also use [trigger warnings](basic trigger
        warning description] to warn people about possibly distressing content.
        *Don't ask intrusive questions. Just because a person is different, it doesn't
        mean they want to be asked awkward questions.*
        This means: Don't ask trans people about their genitals, don't ask bi/pan
        people who they've slept with and so on.
        NOTES:
        How not to be a jerk?
        First off, don't assume anything. You can't tell what a persons sexuality
        is by looking at them, who they're dating, or who they've dated. If somone
        straight has never dated anyone, does that make them asexual? Nope. The
        only way is to ask.  If you see somone who you think might be trans, treat
        them as the gender they're presenting as. If you're confused, ask politley
        which pronouns you should use to describe them.
        Be aware that QUILTBAG people are going to have different needs and
        different problems - the needs of people who are QUILTBAG can also differ
        based on circumstances and how their different identities interact.
        If somone asks you to not talk aout something because it's causing them
        distress, stop talking aout it. If you know a certain topic may be
        distressing, put a note warning people at the top so you don't trigger a
        panic attack, or similar.

        *Intersex people do not fit into a binary (male/female) model of sex*
        Approximately 1% of people fit the label "Intersex"
        (http://www.isna.org/faq/frequency)*
        Sex isn't binary. Some people's bodies don't fit neatly into the
        "male" or "female" categories of sex.
        *To force the binary model of sex upon Intersex people they are often
        sterilized at a young age*
        Preventing this is one of the primary struggles of intersex activists.
        *Sex refers to biological attributes - primary and secondary sexual
        characteristics, chromosomes and hormones.*
        There are a number of ways you could define sex - a more
        comprehensive one takes into account a wide range of sex-determined
        characteristics.

        *Often sexual and romantic orientation are he same but they can be different- You can be Pan butgq
        homoromantic*
        I.E. you would be sexually attracted to people of all genders but only
        desiring romantic relations with someone of the same gender.
        *A lot of the people who have mismatched sexual and romantic orientation
        are asexual, but it’s in no way limited to them.*
        NOTES:
        Romantic and Sexual Orientation
        For some people(often, but not limited to asexual people), the pattern of
        people they are romantically attracted to differs from the pattern they are
        sexually attracted to.
        Romantic and Sexual orientation are not necessarily linked, but usually
        are.
        A person can be romantically attracted to someone, but not sexually
        attracted to them.
        It's possible to be, say, pansexual but homoromantic. In that case, the
        person would be sexually attracted to people of all genders but only
        romantically attracted to people of the same gender.

        </h1>
        Page Draft:
        *Gender identity is a  persons sense of gender: whether they feel they
        are male, female of somthing else*
        People who feel they are somthing else are called non-binary.
        *A person will have a gender assigned to them at birth. This will be
        the gender put on your (first) birth certificate.*
        The gender assigned is usually based on the genitalia of the person at
        birth. In some cases, it's difficult to make a decision. See Intersex.
        *Transgender people are people who's gender are different to that to
        that they were assigned at birth.*
        A person who's gender matches that assigned to them at birth is called
        cisgender (cis.)
        *Trans\* identities are a spectrum: there are more options than male or
        female, such as genderqueer.*
        These are called "non-binary" genders. The traditional man/woman
        genders are not used in all societies.
        *Most trans\* people have pronouns they want to you to use. Use them -
        if you don't know, ask.*
        *Gender expression is how a person physically presents themselves. For
        example: wearing masculine or feminine clothes.*
        Gender expression Doesn't nessicerrily corrleate to gender identiy,
        or any other part of their person.
        *A lot of trans people will have some level of discomfort with their
        bodies. This is known as dysphoria.*
        *Some trans* people will undertake procedures such as surgery or hormone
        replacments.*
        This does not make them "more trans". What procedures somone has undertaken are non of your buisness.
        *It's none of your business what procedures a trans person has
        undertaken*
        Medical procedures are personal choice available to some trans* people,
        but choosing not undergo them if they have this option does not make
        somone less trans\*
        *Gender can be fluid - it can change over time, sometimes very
        rapidly.*
        People who's gender is very fluid often identify as
        genderfluid.
        NOTES:
        Trans people
        Trans people are born with a body that is not the same as their gender.
        Sometimes they man or a woman, sometimes somewhere intbetween
        and sometimes completey unrelated to traditional genders.
        Trans people may look like ("present') however they want; this does not
        change their gender identity.

        <h2>
          Polyamory literally means "many loves" - it's a relationship structure that's inclusive of the partners having other partners.
        </h2>
        <section>
          <h1>
            Polyamory is not cheating. Polyamory is when a relationship is
            specifically negotiated to include the capacity for other partners.
          </h1>
          It's still possible to 'cheat' in a polyamorous relationship

            There are many forms of Polyamorous relationship. Relationships can be

          Given that, in a lot of cases, the partners in a poly relationship will

            Some poly relationships include the capacity for partners to have just
            other sexual partners.
          </h1>
          This is generally called an 'Open Relationship' - the partners
          can have sex with others so long as there isn't emotional or
          romantic commitment.
        </section>
        <section>

            Other poly relationships allow the partners to have other romantic and
            sexual partners.
          </h1>
          This is generally considered to be less restrictive, but what is
          acceptable and desirable to the couple is the thing that matters.
        </section>
        <section>
          <h1>
            Different poly relationships will be more or less restrictive about the
            conditions of one of the partners having outside relations.
          </h1>
          These conditions might include having the right to veto a partners'
          partner and being informed (or never informed) of their partners'
          goings on.
        </section>
        <section>
          <h1>
            There's no one 'right' poly relationship. Poly relationships
            are very much based on the partners' needs and desires.
          </h1>
          Given that polyamory is greatly different from the cultural scripts of
          monogamy, poly people tend to find they have to make their own rules to
          suit them without relying on the 'accepted' way to do things.

        Page Draft:
        *Asexuality is a lack of sexual attraction to anyone. It is not the
        same as celibacy, the choice not to have sex.*
        Asexuals often refer to themselves as "ace." Aromantic asexuals often
        use "aro-ace."
        *Asexuals are capable of having sex and masturbating - some do. Some
        ace people dislike sex, but others can enjoy it.*
        Just because somone has sex, or enjoys it, It doesn't mean they're

        who experience sexual attraction or a sex drive very rarely.*
        *A Demisexual is a person who doesn't experience sexual attraction
        without a strong emotional connection.*
        Demisexuals don't feel attraction to people without this bond, rather
        than making a choice not to have sex with them.
        NOTES:
        Asexuality
        Asexual people aren’t sexually attracted to anyone.
        Some asexual people call themselves ‘aces’ for short.
        These people can still have a libido (get horny) and/or enjoy sex. They may
        also dislike sex, or be indifferent.
        These people can still form strong, meaningful romantic relationships.
        Asexuality is not the same as celibacy. Celibate people may feel sexual
        attraction but choose not to have sex; asexual people are not sexually
        attracted to people but may still choose to have sex for other reasons.
