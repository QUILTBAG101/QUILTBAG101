<p>These issues are complex. 
    <em>You’re not going to know everything. If a QUILTBAG+ person asks you to
    treat them a certain way, take their advice.</em></p>

<pre><code>*People are human regardless of their identities, but QUILTBAG
people are different and have different needs.*

*A lot of QUILTBAG people won't fit stereotypes(but some will)*

*Someone idenitifying QUILTBAG doesn’t mean that you have the right to ask
 them invasive questions.*
 Who they’ve had relationships or sex with or how is none of your business.
