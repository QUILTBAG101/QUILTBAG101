  *Queer is a slur used to attack QUILTBAG+ people that some have adopted
  as an identity.*
  Queer is a political, sexual and gender identity. It is often used in
  conjunction with other identities.
  *However, you should be incredibly careful with using the word Queer to
  refer to other people.*
  Many people feel that queer is insulting to them, or they do not fit
  under the queer umbrella.
  *People use it as a term to refer to all politically marginialized
  gender and sexual identities.*
  This includes trans* people, kinky people, and non-monsexual people.
  *Unsure is also part of the QUILTBAG acronym. People who are Unsure
  are unsure about their gender or sexual identity.*
  Some people also use "questioning" in place of unsure.
  NOTES:

  identities listed here, alongside comunities like the kink community, who
  are excepted from the mainstream.
  Unsure is a label, supprisingly, for people who are not sure what their
  sexuality is.
