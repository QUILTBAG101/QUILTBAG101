      These issues are complex.
      *You're not going to know everything. If a QUILTBAG+ person asks you to
      treat them a certain way, take their advice.*
      *People are human regardless of their identities, but QUILTBAG
      people are different and have different needs.*
      *A lot of QUILTBAG people won't fit stereotypes(but some will)*
      *Someone idenitifying QUILTBAG doesn’t mean that you have the right to ask
      them invasive questions.*
      Who they’ve had relationships or sex with or how is none of your business.
