    poly Amory
  </h1>
  <h2>
    Polyamory literally means "many loves" - it's a relationship structure that's inclusive of the partners having other partners.
  </h2>

    <h1>
      Polyamory is not cheating. Polyamory is when a relationship is
      specifically negotiated to include the capacity for other partners.
    </h1>
    It's still possible to 'cheat' in a polyamorous relationship
    by breaking an agreement with your partner.

    <h1>
      There are many forms of Polyamorous relationship. Relationships can be
      negotiated and re-negotiated to fit the partners' needs.
    </h1>
    Given that, in a lot of cases, the partners in a poly relationship will
    be exploring new ground - boundaries often have to be renegotiated as
    they realise they are more or less comfortable with certain things.

    <h1>
      Polyamory isn't for everyone. Some people prefer monogamous
      relationships, others prefer poly ones.
    </h1>
    Don't judge people based on their preference either way. Neither is
    objectively better.

      Some poly relationships include the capacity for partners to have just
      other sexual partners.
    </h1>
    This is generally called an 'Open Relationship' - the partners
    can have sex with others so long as there isn't emotional or
    romantic commitment.

    <h1>
      Other poly relationships allow the partners to have other romantic and
      sexual partners.
    </h1>
    This is generally considered to be less restrictive, but what is
    acceptable and desirable to the couple is the thing that matters.

    <h1>
      Different poly relationships will be more or less restrictive about the
      conditions of one of the partners having outside relations.
    </h1>
    These conditions might include having the right to veto a partners'
    partner and being informed (or never informed) of their partners'
    goings on.

    <h1>
      There's no one 'right' poly relationship. Poly relationships
      are very much based on the partners' needs and desires.
    </h1>
    Given that polyamory is greatly different from the cultural scripts of
    monogamy, poly people tend to find they have to make their own rules to
    suit them without relying on the 'accepted' way to do things.

    <h1>
      Polyamory is 'consensual non-monogamy' - that is, a relationship
      can only be considered poly if everyone agrees.
    </h1>
    The opposite of this is non-consensual non-monogamy - I.E. cheating.
