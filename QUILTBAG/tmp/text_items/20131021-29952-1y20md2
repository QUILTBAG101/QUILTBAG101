        <em>Bisexuality is attraction to more than one gender. Pansexuality is
        attraction to all genders.</em> 
        The two can overlap, and these are not strict definitions. The 
        person gets to decide what label/s they use - please respect that.</p>

<pre><code>    *Bi/Pansexuals aren’t attracted to everyone, just have the capacity to
    be attracted to more genders.* 
    In the same way a gay or straight person isn’t attracted to all people
    of the same/”opposite”-gender.

    *Bi/Pansexuals aren’t promiscuous or more liable to cheat. Some are,
    but not \*because\* they’re bisexual.*
    Neither trustworthiness nor preference for non-monogamy are related to 
    sexual orientation.
    
    *Bi/Pansexuality is a valid orientation, not just a phase. It can be a
    phase for some, and that’s ok.*

    *They don’t necessarily want to have sex with you, or a threesome. They
    might do, but not /*because/* they’re bisexual.*  

    *A Bi/Pansexual doesn’t become gay or straight if they start a
    monogamous relationship.*
    Sexual orientation doesn’t go away. Don't assume people's orientation
    based on what (or who) they are currently doing.

<p>NOTES:
Pansexual, Bisexual etc. people.
    They exist. They are not gay and afraid to come out. Neither are they doing it for the attention.
    They just have the capacity to experience sexual attraction to people of more than one gender.
    They don’t want to sex everyone.
    They (probably) do not want to have a threesome with you. And if they do, it’s not <em>because</em> they’re bi or pan.
    Non-monosexuals are not necessarily poly, but they can be.
    Some people use bisexual to mean “attracted to men and women”; some use it to mean “attracted to people regardless of gender”.
    Some people prefer pansexual, because they believe bisexual enforces the gender binary, or for other reasons.
    Other people prefer bisexual.
