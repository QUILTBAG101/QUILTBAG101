<p>NOTES: Introduction section Welcome to QUILTBAG 101, a primer for people who
need to know more about sexuality and gender.  What is QUILTBAG? It stands for:
Q - Queer/Questioning U - Unsure
        I - Intersex
        L - Lesbian
        T - Trans*
        B - Bisexual
        A - Asexual
        G - Gay/Genderqueer
    Over the next few slides, we’re going to roll through what all of those 
        mean to different people, and how many people who identify with one or 
        more of those categories would like you to treat them.
    We’re not trying to speak for everyone, but this will probably stop you from
        making any mortal enemies, and we’ll recommend some more thorough reading
        later on.</p>
