        Queer is a slur sometimes used to attack QUILTBAG+ people that some 
        have adopted as an identity.
    Queer is a political, sexual and gender identity. It is often used in
    conjunction with other identities.

        Unsure is also part of the QUILTBAG+ acronym. People who are unsure
        are unsure about their gender or sexual identity.
    Some people also use "questioning" in place of unsure.
