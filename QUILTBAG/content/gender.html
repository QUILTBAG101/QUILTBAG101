        Gender identity is a person's sense of gender: whether they feel they 
        are male, female of something else.
    If your gender is different to the one you were asgined at birth then you 
    are trans*. People who feel they are something else are called non-binary.

        Transgender people are people whose gender is different to the one 
        they were assigned at birth.
    A person whose gender matches that assigned to them at birth is called
    cisgender (cis).

        Trans* identities are a spectrum: there are more options than male or
        female, such as genderqueer.
    These are called "non-binary" genders. The traditional man/woman
    genders are not used in all societies.

        Most trans* people have pronouns they want you to use. Use them -
        if you don't know, ask.

        Gender expression is how a person physically presents themselves. For
        example: wearing masculine or feminine clothes.
    Gender expression doesn't necessarily correlate to gender identiy, 
    or any other part of their person.

        A lot of trans* people will have some level of discomfort with their
        bodies. This is known as dysphoria.

        Some trans* people will undertake procedures such as surgery or hormone
        replacments. 
    This does not make them "more trans*". What procedures someone has undertaken are none of your buisness.
