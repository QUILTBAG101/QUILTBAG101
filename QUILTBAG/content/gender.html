        A person's gender is a matter personal to them and is an issue of personal identification and self-determination.
    You can't necessarily tell it by looking at them.

        Transgender people are people whose gender is different to the one 
        they were assigned at birth.
    A person whose gender matches that assigned to them at birth is called
    cisgender, or cis.

        Trans identities are a spectrum: there are more options than male or
        female.
    These are called "non-binary" genders in western society. Not every other society has a male/female binary in the same way contemporary western cultures do.

        Most trans people have pronouns they want you to use. Use them -
        if you don't know, ask.
    Personal pronouns are the small word used instead of their name in a sentence, i.e. "She", "He", "They", "Him" and "Xem."

        Gender expression is how a person physically presents themselves. For
        example: wearing masculine or feminine coded clothes.
    Gender expression doesn't necessarily correlate to gender, 
    or any other part of their person.

        A lot of trans people will have some level of discomfort with their
        bodies. This is known as dysphoria.

        Some trans people will undertake procedures such as surgery or hormone
        replacements. 
    This does not make them "more trans". What procedures someone has undertaken are none of your business.
