        Don't assume anything. You can&#39;t tell a person's sexuality by who they're
        dating or who they've dated, for instance.
Following this simple rule will result in a 99% reduction in the amount of
times you put your foot in your mouth.

        Use the pronouns that someone requests you use. If you're not sure about them,
        ask politely. 
    Pronouns really aren't that hard to learn. Don't complain that
    they're "made up" or grammatically incorrect, just use them.

        Different QUILTBAG+ groups have different needs and problems. Be aware of this
        when dealing with them.
    There are also some problems that arise as a result of
    being several identities - this is known as intersectionality.

        If someone asks you not to talk about something because it's causing them
        distress, stop talking about it.
    When writing you should also warn people about possibly distressing content.

        Don't ask intrusive questions. Just because a person is different doesn't
        mean they want to be asked awkward questions.
    This means: Don't ask trans people about their genitals, don't ask bi/pan
    people who they've slept with and so on.
