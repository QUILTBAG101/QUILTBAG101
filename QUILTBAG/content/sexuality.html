        Often sexual and romantic orientation are the same but they can be different. You can be 
        pansexual but homoromantic.
    I.e. you would be sexually attracted to people of all genders but only
    desiring romantic relationships with someone of the same gender.

        A lot of the people who have mismatched sexual and romantic orientation
        are asexual, but it&#39;s in no way limited to them.
