        These issues are complex. 
    You're not going to know everything. If a QUILTBAG+ person asks you to
    treat them a certain way, take their advice.

        People are human regardless of their identities, but QUILTBAG
        people are different and have different needs.

        A lot of QUILTBAG people won't fit stereotypes(but some will)

        Someone idenitifying QUILTBAG doesn&#39;t mean that you have the right to ask
        them invasive questions.
    Who they&#39;ve had relationships or sex with or how is none of your business.
