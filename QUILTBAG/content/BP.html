        Bisexuality is attraction to more than one gender. Pansexuality is
        attraction to all genders.
    The two can overlap, and these are not strict definitions. The 
    person gets to decide what label/s they use - please respect that.

        Bi/Pansexuals aren&#39;t attracted to everyone, just have the capacity to
        be attracted to more genders.
    In the same way a gay or straight person isn&#39;t attracted to all people
    of the same/&#34;opposite&#34;-gender.

        Bi/Pansexuals aren&#39;t promiscuous or more liable to cheat. Some are,
        but not because they&#39;re bisexual.
    Neither trustworthiness nor preference for non-monogamy are related to 
    sexual orientation.

        Bi/Pansexuality is a valid orientation, not just a phase - although it can be a
        phase for some, and that&#39;s ok.

        They don&#39;t necessarily want to have sex with you, or a threesome. They
        might do, but not because they&#39;re bisexual.

%section
    %h1
        A Bi/Pansexual doesn&#39;t become gay or straight if they start a
        monogamous relationship.
    Sexual orientation doesn&#39;t go away. Don&#39;t assume people&#39;s orientation
    based on what (or who) they are currently doing.
