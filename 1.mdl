Introduction section
    Welcome to QUILT?BAG 101, a primer for people who need to know more about 
        sexuality and gender.
    What is QUILTBAG? It stands for:
        Q - Queer/Questioning
        U - Unsure
        I - Intersex
        L - Lesbian
        T - Trans*
        B - Bisexual
        A - Asexual
        G - Gay/Genderqueer
    Over the next few slides, we're going to roll through what all of those 
        mean to different people, and how many people who identify with one or 
        more of those categories would like you to treat them.
    We're not trying to speak for everyone, but this will probably stop you from
        making any mortal enemies, and we'll recommend some more thorough reading
        later on.

Draft:
	QUILTBAG101 is a primer for people who want to know more about alternative sexuality, gender and sex.
	
	QUILTBAG stands for Queer/Questioning, Unsure, Intersex, Lesbian, Trans*, Bisexual, Asexual, Gay/Genderqueer.
	
	QUILTBAG101 will explain what these groups are, what they mean to the people who are in them and how to treat QUILTBAG people.
	
	Human sexuality, gender and sex is complicated but we hope to provide enough resources so that you don't offend anyone.
	Too complicated to deal with in its entirity in such little space.
	
	If you're interested further, we have a lot of further reading available for you - we would advise that you take a look.
	
	The important thing to remember is that QUILTBAG people are fundamentally people, regardless of their identity.

	But, QUILTBAG people are different - they have different needs and problems.
	
	A lot of QUILTBAG people won't fit your pre-concieved notions and stereotypes of what they should be like.
	Although some will - but still, expect to be surprised.
