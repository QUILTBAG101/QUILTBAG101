Introduction section
    Welcome to QUILT?BAG 101, a primer for people who need to know more about 
        sexuality and gender.
    What is QUILTBAG? It stands for:
        Q - Queer/Questioning
        U - Unsure
        I - Intersex
        L - Lesbian
        T - Trans*
        B - Bisexual
        A - Asexual
        G - Gay/Genderqueer
    Over the next few slides, we're going to roll through what all of those 
        mean to different people, and how people who identify with one or more 
        of those categories would like to be treated.
    We're not trying to speak for everyone, but this will probably stop you from
        making any mortal enemies, and we'll recommend some more thorough reading
        later on.
