Introduction section
    Welcome to QUILT?BAG 101, a primer for people who need to know more about 
        sexuality and gender.
    What is QUILTBAG? It stands for:
        Q - Queer/Questioning
        U - Unsure
        I - Intersex
        L - Lesbian
        T - Trans*
        B - Bisexual
        A - Asexual
        G - Gay/Genderqueer
    Over the next few slides, we're going to roll through what all of those 
        mean to different people, and how you should treat people who say 
        they're in those categories 
    We're not trying to speak for everyone, but this will probably stop you from
        making any mortal enemies, and we reccomend some more thourgh reading
        later on.
