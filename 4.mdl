    They (probably) do not want to have a threesome with you. And if they do, it's not because they're bi or pan.
    They are not gay and afraid to come out. 
    They just have the capacity to experience sexual attraction to people of more than one gender.
    They don't want to sex everyone.
    Non-monosexuals are not necessarily poly, but they can be.
