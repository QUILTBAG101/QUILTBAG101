Pansexual, Bisexual etc. people.
    They exist. They are not gay and afraid to come out. Neither are they doing it for the attention.
    They just have the capacity to experience sexual attraction to people of more than one gender.
    They don't want to sex everyone.
    They (probably) do not want to have a threesome with you. And if they do, it's not *because* they're bi or pan.
    Non-monosexuals are not necessarily poly, but they can be.
    Some people use bisexual to mean "attracted to men and women"; some use it to mean "attracted to people regardless of gender".
    Some people prefer pansexual, because they believe bisexual enforces the gender binary, or for other reasons.
    Other people prefer bisexua.
    Whatever label, it doesn't really matter. [Plugs self -CH] http://www.charliehale.net/2013/06/attracted-to-kitchen-implements.html
