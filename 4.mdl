Pansexual, Bisexual Etc people. 
    They just have the capacity to experience sexual attraction to people of more than one gender.
    They don't want to sex everyone.
    They (probably) do not want to have a threesome with you. And if they do, it's not because they're bi or pan.
    They are not gay and afraid to come out. 
    Non-monosexuals are not necessarily poly, but they can be.
    Some people prefer pansexual, because they believe bisexual enforces the gender binary or other reasons.
    Other people prefer bisexual.
    Whatever label, it doesn't really matter. [Plugs self -CH] http://www.charliehale.net/2013/06/attracted-to-kitchen-implements.html
