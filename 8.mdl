        *Queer is an umbrella term for people in gender and sexual minorities -
        arguably, anything not mainstream.*

        *Some people prefer to use Queer as a label instead of anything else.
        This is perfectly fine.*

        *However, you should be careful with using the word Queer to refer to
        other people. It has a long and painful history for some.*

        *Unsure is also part of the QUILTBAG acronym. People who are Unsure
        are... unsure about their gender or sexual identity.*
