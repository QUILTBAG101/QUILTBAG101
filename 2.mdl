These issues are complex. 
    You're not going to know everything there is to know.  If somone in the
    QUILTBAG+ spectrum asks you to treat them a certain way, take their advice.
    
    People are not evil, lesser, or weird because of them being QUILTBAG.
    
    People are fundamentally human regardless of their identities, but QUILTBAG
    people are different and sometimes have different needs.
    
    A lot of QUILTBAG people won't fit your preconcieved notions of what they
    should be like. Some will, but expect to be surprised at the diversity.
