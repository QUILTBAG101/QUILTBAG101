Don't assume anything. You can't tell a person's sexuality by who they're dating or who they've dated, for instance.

Use the pronouns that someone requests you use. If you're not sure about them, ask politely.

Different QUILTBAG groups have different needs and problems. Be aware of this when dealing with them.

If someone asks you not to talk about something because it's causing them distress, stop talking about it.

Trigger warnings on potentially distressing material are good - mention if something contains potentially distressing content.

NOTES:
How not to be a jerk?
    First off, don't assume anything. You can't tell what a persons sexuality
    is by looking at them, who they're dating, or who they've dated. If somone
    straight has never dated anyone, does that make them asexual? Nope. The
    only way is to ask.  If you see somone who you think might be trans, treat
    them as the gender they're presenting as. If you're confused, ask politley
    which pronouns you should use to describe them. 
    
    Be aware that QUILTBAG people are going to have different needs and different problems - the needs of people who are QUILTBAG can also differ based on circumstances and how their different identities interact.
    
    If somone asks you to not talk aout something because it's causing them
    distress, stop talking aout it. If you know a certain topic may be
    distressing, put a note warning people at the top so you don't trigger a
    panic attack, or similar.
