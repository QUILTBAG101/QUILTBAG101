How not to be a *DCJDSF*FS*SDF* <somone please give me a good non gendered seafe insult here?
    First off, don't assume anything. You can't tell what a persons sexuality is y looking at them, who they're dating, or who they've dated. If somone straight has never dated anyone, does that make them asexual? Nope. The only way is to ask.
    If you see somone who you think might be trans, treat them as the gender they're presenting as. If you're confused, ask politley which pronouns you should use to describe them. 
    one line explanation of privilege someone?
    If somone asks you to not talk aout somthing ecause it's causing them distress, stop talking aout it. If you know a certain topic may be distressing, put a note warning people at the top so you don't trigger a panic attack, or similar.
