        *Polyamory literally means 'many loves' - it's a relationship
        structure that's inclusive of the partners having other partners..

        *Polyamory is 'consensual non-monogamy' - that is, a relationship
        can only be considered poly if everyone agrees.*
        The opposite of this is non-consensual non-monogamy - I.E. cheating.
		
		*Poly relationships allow the partners to have other romantic and/or
        sexual partners.*
		Sometimes this means a partner is allowed to have sex as long as
		there's no romantic or emotional attachment. Other times they're
		allowed to form full relationships.

        *There are many forms of Polyamorous relationship. Relationships can be
        negotiated and re-negotiated to fit the partners' needs.*
        Boundaries often have to be renegotiated as
        the partners realise they are more or less comfortable with certain things.

        *Different poly relationships will be more or less restrictive about the
        conditions of one of the partners having outside relations.*
        These conditions might include having the right to veto a partners'
        partner and being informed (or never informed) of their partners'
        goings on.
